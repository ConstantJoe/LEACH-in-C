# LEACH-in-C
An implementation of the LEACH algorithm, written in C. 

This is a port of a Matlab implementation of LEACH, which was written by Mohammad Hossein Homaei of the Wireless Sensor Network Laboratory of Iran, and is based on the *original* version of LEACH described by Heinzelman et. al. in "An Application-Specific Protocol Architecture for Wireless Microsensor Networks".

This work is currently in progress. 

**To do:**

	Collect relevant data about each round and output it to a file.

	Add --help flag

	Compare results to the Matlab version.

	Implement a proper wireless propagation model. As of now it is assumed all messages reach their destination.

	Visualisation of results

	Later, convert to a version that can be ran on Contiki OS (and so simulated using Cooja)
